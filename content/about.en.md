Hi, I'm Mazlum, a developer who mainly works on web technologies. I have been working on web and mobile application development since 2012-2013. While programming, NodeJS, JavaScript, and TypeScript are my primary programming languages, and I also have basic knowledge of Java and Objective-C. I predominantly use Firebase, but occasionally work with MongoDB and SQL databases. On the web side, I use Angular2+, and for mobile, I use the Ionic Framework.

I love playing games. I used to run Minecraft servers back in the day. Apart from online games, I really enjoy story-based games.

On my blog page, I will share content about the technologies I'm working on and find interesting.

Best regards.
