## After 4 Years of Silence

Yes, after nearly 4 years of neglecting this blog that I created whenever I found time to write, I'm finally stepping back onto this path. Let's see what happens!

So, what happened during this time? I tried developing a bunch of projects—most of them turned out to be garbage, honestly. I built software for crypto, made some decent money, but ended up losing it all due to my own mistakes. Well, I guess it's the price you pay for learning.

## Everything Changed with AI

I've embarked on a new path this past year. I've been developing software since around 2012-2013, and honestly, since AI entered our lives in the last 1-2 years, **everything has changed dramatically**.

In fact, I'm even getting help while writing this blog post because AI has better language skills than me and helps me fix my narrative issues—no lies here :)

Anyway, over all these years, I've gained experience in so many things that I honestly never would have predicted in software development. However, out of all the things I've learned and worked on, two topics have always brought me the most joy:

### 1. Scraping
### 2. Security

## Two Passions: Scraping and Security

I think these two feed into each other. On one side, you have scraping data and overcoming obstacles, while on the other, you have defending and protecting. Think of it like two sides of the same coin.

### Companyze.com - B2B Intelligence Platform

On the scraping side, I'm currently developing a product called **[companyze.com](https://companyze.com)**.

This product is actually for people working in B2B. Its purpose is to gather as much intelligence as possible about potential customers, allowing you to truly know your clients.

**I believe you can't make sales without knowing your audience.** This is exactly where it comes into play.

### RapidScan.app - Bot Protection and Security Consulting

On the security side, I'm also developing a product called **[rapidscan.app](https://rapidscan.app)**. This product is divided into two main services:

#### 1. Bot Protection

I'm about to finish this product, and in fact, my next blog posts might be about it. But to put it briefly, its purpose is to protect your API or website from DDoS and bot attacks as effectively as possible.

I don't think it's a complex project, but the internet is changing so fast that you have to keep your bot protection algorithm constantly updated and live. Otherwise, it becomes useless.

#### 2. Security Consulting

This is actually a one-time service I sell. I share all the knowledge I've accumulated over the years with people, examining their projects and producing detailed security reports.

In fact, just yesterday I think I made a business deal with **[Marc Louvion](https://x.com/marc_louvion)** and subjected one of his projects to security testing. Marc might be one of the best entrepreneurs I've met on the internet. The fact that he produces so fast and is so successful isn't luck, in my opinion—he's genuinely very smart.

*Alright, enough praise :)*

## Conclusion

In the end, the reason I'm creating this product is, as I said, because it feeds what I truly enjoy doing. I haven't finished it yet, but I hope it will be done soon.

That's it for now regarding my personal career developments.

**Note:** I'm kind of using this place as a journal, to pour my heart out and clear my mind. Just in case there's someone out there who wants to read my boring writings :)

See you in the next post!
